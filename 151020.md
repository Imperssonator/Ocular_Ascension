## Peeled samples:
* really old, gel-y P3HT in a solvent mix
* HMDS spun on a chip, then P3HT spun, then removed to study interface

## HMDS Peel Tape Razor.001
* 2.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 410.77
* IGain: 1.5
* PGain: 7
* FIBERS. ON THE INTERFACE. SIMBA IS DOWN THERE.
* This sample was soaked in pentane "overnight" (all pentane was evaporated in morning) and a ring came off with scotch tape. Epoxy was applied to the back of the tape and it was mounted on a razor blade.

## HMDS P3HT pentane scotch copper glass.001
* 2.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 410.77
* IGain: .4
* PGain: 4
* So many fibers on the surface.
* This sample was soaked overnight in sealed pentane. Immediately after residual solvent evaporated from the surface, scotch tape was applied and peeled off. The film did not come off over the electrodes. The tape was put upside down on copper tape on a glass slide.

## HMDS P3HT pentane scotch copper glass.002
* 2.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 410.77
* IGain: .4
* PGain: 4
* Excellent image.

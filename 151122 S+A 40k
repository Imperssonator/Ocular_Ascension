## 2-3
* Channel width = vertical

## 2-3.001
* Middle of channel
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Really cool image. I think I can see the bottom layer of fibers. They are vertically aligned.

## 2-3.002
* Middle of channel
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Very similar to .001, this is good

## 2-3.003
* South end of channel (entrance)
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* A bit further to the right side of the channel... but fibers seem to still be angled NNE... this is odd.

## 2-3.004
* North end of channel (exit)
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Pretty much dead center. Fibers are very aligned. This is all going to fit together in a crazy way.

## 2-3.005
* Back towards middle but still north
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Great set

## 0-3
* Channel width = vertical

## 0-3.001
* North channel (exit)
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Fibers, at least 1um in length. Orientation is more random! They are also more sparse.

## 0-3.002
* South channel (entrance)
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Looking about the same.

## 0-3.003
* Mid channel
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Looking about the same.

## 0-3.004
* Mid-north channel
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Tip starting to go to shit

## 0-3.00
* Mid-south channel
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Tip really pushing it. If analysis looks bad do it again.

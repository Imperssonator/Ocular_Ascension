Running the silicon squares to be sent off to SLAC. A series of 7 films were made at the following conditions:
10 mg P3HT
2000 µL CHCl3
350 µL 2-methylpentane
Sonicated 2 minutes

| Sample | Conditions                    |
|:------:|-------------------------------|
|Glass1  |taken 30 sec after sonication  |
|Glass2  |2 min after |
|Glass3  |4 min after |

The solution was split in two vials at this point

| Sample | Conditions                    |
|:------:|-------------------------------|
|Glass4  |Aged 1 day in fridge  |
|Glass5  |Aged 1 day in drawer  |
|Glass6  |Repeat of Glass4      |
|Glass7  |Repeat of Glass5, but will be used for brushing experiments|

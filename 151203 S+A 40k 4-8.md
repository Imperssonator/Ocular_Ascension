## 4-T2-2
* Channel width = vertical
* Off-center spun, flow should be... maybe diagonal SE-ish

* No .001... duplicate accidentally

## 4-T2-2.002
* Middle of channel
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* For sure long fibers, badly oriented but definite E/SE bias. Paper is gonna write itself.

## 4-T2-2.003
* South channel
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* Oriented almost straight SE.. pretty good order as well.

## 4-T2-2.004
* North
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples

## 4-T2-2.005
* Mid-North
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples

## 4-T2-2.006
* Mid-South
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* This whole set is great

## 4-1
* Channel width = vertical
* "Absolutely Perfect Spin" ... looking for vertical alignment... and got it

## 4-1.001
* Mid
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* annd vertical orientation abounds

## 4-1.002
* North
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* kind of disordered! not really tho

## 4-1.003
* South
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* Quite vertical

## 4-1.004
* Basically middle, a bit North
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* Quite vertical

## 4-1.005
* Mid South
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* lookin kinda disordered
 
## 8-3
* Channel width = vertical
* Good spin

## 8-3.001
* Mid
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* pretty vertical but looking pretty disordered

## 8-3.002
* South
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* very much NE

## 8-3.003
* North
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* Quite vertical

## 8-3.004
* Mid North
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* Quite vertical

## 8-3.005
* Mid South
* 10 um
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples
* lookin kinda disordered



## 4-T1-2
* Channel width = vertical
* Center channel on a trip device, spin was centered on this channel. Looking for random orientation.

## 4-T1-2.001
* Middle of channel
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Long fibers but seemingly random orientation. However, still bundles.

## 4-T1-2.002
* North
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Same as above

## 4-T1-2.003
* South
* 10 um
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples
* Messy. Lots of dots and bubbles and crap.

## Changed tip

## 4-T1-2.004
* Mid-North
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* Looking a bit too ordered for my tastes

## 4-T1-2.005
* Mid-South
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples
* This one should put the nail in the coffin

## 4-2
* Channel width = vertical
* The lower mobility of the single channel 4 day devices. Possibly less ordered? Or just because it got characterized later?

## 4-2.001
* Middle of channel
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples
* Maybe it's less oriented than 4-1?

## 4-2.002
* South
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples
* Went to get Pho. Forgot to capture. Exists as a screenshot in Google Drive.

## 4-2.003
* Mid-north
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples
* Looking pretty vertical... this might not work.

## 4-2.004
* Mid-south
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples
* Kind of random!

## 4-2.005
* Middle
* 10 um
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples
* Kind of random!

## Tip not done
* In Reichmanis 11.18, Tip (2,2) in matlab index notation is still great

Running the sonication + waiting films. Three samples were taken with 5 replicate solutions. The initial solution was as follows:

* 20 mg P3HT
* 4000 µL CHCl3
* 700 µL 2-MP

This was divided into 5 separate solutions 1-5 which were all subjected to a series of treatments:

| Sample | Conditions                      |
|:------:|---------------------------------|
|Pre     |Spun from pristine solution      |
|Son     |Spun 40 seconds after sonication |
|Wait    |Spun 1 hour after sonication     |

# AFM
## Son5.001
* 5.0 µm
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 503.2
* Some fibers, some clumpier regions. Fibers not very long.

## Son5.002
* 5.0 µm
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 503.2
* Captured electrode edge!

## Son5.003
* 5.0 µm
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 503.2
* Moved a little left, same electrode edge. Morphology sucks in channel!

## Son5.004
* 1.66 µm
* X Offset 703.125 nm
* Y Offset 488.281 nm
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 503.2
* Zoomed in to confirm crappy morphology of channel in Son5.003, seems to be confirmed. Further analysis required.
* Slightly off left, down a bit from center of Son5.003

## Son5.005
* 5.0 µm
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 600
* Tried to get between Son5.002 and Son5.003 to see where morphology changes... Now gold is crappy, channel is good!

## Son5.006
* 5.0 µm
* 1 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 600
* Maybe a few microns to the right of Son5.005, looking for morphological transition

## Wait1.001
* 5.0 µm
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 600
* Center of channel

## Wait1.002
* 5.0 µm
* 0.6 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 700
* Just above .002 at electrode edge, tip craps out after descending edge.

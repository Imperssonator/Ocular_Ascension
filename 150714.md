Running the sonication + waiting films. Three samples were taken with 5 replicate solutions. The initial solution was as follows:

20 mg P3HT
4000 µL CHCl3
700 µL 2-MP

This was divided into 5 separate solutions 1-5 which were all subjected to a series of treatments:

| Sample | Conditions                      |
|:------:|---------------------------------|
|Pre     |Spun from pristine solution      |
|Son   |Spun 40 seconds after sonication |
|Wait    |Spun 1 hour after sonication     |

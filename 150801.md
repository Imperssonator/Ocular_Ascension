Running the sonication + waiting films. Three samples were taken with 5 replicate solutions. The initial solution was as follows:

* 20 mg P3HT
* 4000 µL CHCl3
* 700 µL 2-MP

This was divided into 5 separate solutions 1-5 which were all subjected to a series of treatments:

| Sample | Conditions                      |
|:------:|---------------------------------|
|Pre     |Spun from pristine solution      |
|Son     |Spun 40 seconds after sonication |
|Wait    |Spun 1 hour after sonication     |

# AFM
## Wait1.003
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 250
* Some fibers but not very well resolved

## Wait1.004
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 250
* Top of .004 should overlap with bottom of .003... but stage control is too sloppy to make this possible
* Areas with fibers, areas without

## Wait1.005
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 250
* Taken outside of channel

## Wait2.001
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 150
* Middle of channel

## Wait2.002
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 150
* Moved a bit North (towards top of channel) ... great image

## Wait2.003
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 150
* Taking 3rd sample to define structural error, this one far South in channel (entrance)

## Wait3.001
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 150
* Middle of channel

## Wait3.002
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 150
* Channel entrance

## Wait3.003
* 5.0 µm
* 0.75 Hz
* 512 samples/line
* Drive Amp: 150
* Channel exit

## Wait4.001
